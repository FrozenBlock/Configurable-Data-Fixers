Hello
Put changelog in plain text please
Make sure to clear after release

Put changelog here:
-----------------
- Added schema-based data fixers
  There are 4 types: biome, block, entity, and item
  However, it is recommended to use registry fixers for items.
- Fixed config file name (changes are not automatically transferred, this will have to be done manually)
